Support.  Support.  Support.  Owing to IBM's reach and scale, my company is a mid-size customer, yet IBM has NEVER failed to step up when we have run into an issue.  While these issues are rare, the Planning Analytics product is so important to our business that knowing we have a partner and not just a vendor makes all the difference.  From our account reps to IBM BA&AI executive management, I feel that I can call on any resource needed to ensure success with the Planning Analytics product.\n\n2.  Commitment to \"Run Anywhere and Everywhere\" solutions.  IBM has continued to support its on-premise solutions.  IBM's commitment to public, private and hybrid-cloud delivery is unique in my experience.  This commitment has put us on a path to realizing the benefits of on-cloud without compromising our commitment to protecting our members and every bit of their data. \n\n3.  Continuous innovation.  Having had the opportunity to watch the evolution of Planning Analytics, the constant has been continuous improvement.  Both organically and through acquisition of new technology, the Planning Analytics of today is architecturally unrecognizable from the IBM Cognos Planning product we invested in over a decade ago.  It is infinitely faster, more capable and robust.  Our power users have more choices than ever while our casual users enjoy a consistent experience.  While we have examples of third-party products shelved prior to full-depreciation, thanks to IBM's commitment to innovation, we are as excited about the next ten years of potential in Planning Analytics as we are satisfied with the last ten years of value gained from using the product.","reviewHeadline":"Support, On-Everywhere Delivery and Innovation Ensure Planning Success","upVotes":0,"productSeoNames":["ibm-planning-analytics"],"vendorSeoName":"ibm","sortValue":2.0106633322379097},{"reviewId":1356765,"formattedReviewDate":"May 11, 2020","reviewSourceCode":3,"reviewIncentiveCode":2,"productNames":"IBM Planning Analytics","reviewRating":4,"industryCd":9889,"industryName":"Services","companySizeCd":9901,"companySize":"3B - 10B USD","jobTitle":"Operations Associate","jobRoleCd":9917,"jobRole":"Data and Analytics","reviewSummary":"IBM Planning Analytics is helping us in organizing over budgets forecasting and sales reporting.

We started with budgeting, since our calculations were significantly driver based, and the modeling tool allowed us to build all of the formulas behind the scenes, to allow the users to own just their relevant drivers.

We have since migrated data from numerous other applications in order to maintain a centralized data warehouse.  Here we can correlate the spend of R&M to the age of equipment and the volume of gallons sold.\n\nWe could not be more satisfied with the level of service provided by each department with which we interact, be it sales, development, customer success, or product support.

Anaplan is by far the best solution for enabling an organization to develop streamlined processes around its various planning functions (i.e. finance, supply chain, marketing, HR, sales). It's quick-to-learn interface promotes fast adoption and learning by developers, and increased process efficiency for end users.\n\nIn previous roles, I have also worked on Hyperion and TM1 implementations, and the largest drawback of these systems is the overall inflexibility and steep development learning curve. If the organization requested new reporting capabilities and tweaks to existing processes, the time to delivery was generally lengthy, and troubleshooting was arduous.\n\nWith Anaplan, its user-friendly development engine allows an IT or systems team to rapidly develop, test and deploy new functionality to serve a company's end users. Even in the event of a large disruption to a company's operation, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Anaplan is so flexible a solution that companies are able to quickly shift their planning process and develop new functionality within the platform to solve for unexpected circumstances.","reviewHeadline":"Anaplan provides flexibility and agility not available from other planning tools","upVotes":0,"tags":[{"highlight":"Invest in creating an in-house <em>development</em> <em>team</em> rather than relying solely on consulting partners.
